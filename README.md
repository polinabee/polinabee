### Hi, I'm Polina 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a software and data engineer from San Francisco currently living in ~~Barcelona~~ Paris. My professional focus is in the intersection of engineering and analytics, specifically when it comes to building robust data pipelines, tools for effective analytics, and geospatial data systems. 

When I'm not at my computer you can find me ~~dancing in the air 💃 , standing on my hands 🤸🏻‍♀️~~ doing physiotherapy exercises, or drawing 🎨.

Many of my notebooks and code snippets live [here](https://gist.github.com/polinabee)

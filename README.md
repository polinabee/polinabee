### Hi, I'm Polina 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a software and data engineer from San Francisco. In 2020, I moved very far to study data science at the Barcelona School of Economics, and now I work at Glovo. My professional focus is in the intersection of engineering and analytics, specifically when it comes to building robust data pipelines, tools for effective analytics, and geospatial data systems. Before moving here, I worked at Zillow in the US.

When I'm not at my computer you can find me dancing in the air 💃 , standing on my hands 🤸🏻‍♀️, or drawing 🎨.

Many of my notebooks and code snippets live [here](https://gist.github.com/polinabee)
